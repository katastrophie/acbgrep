"bingrep" is a grep for large binary files. It uses an aho-corasick implementation from fairly fast packet filter to search for multiple patterns at once.

Binary data is passed to bingrep via the command line as hexstrings:

  A => 40

Example usage:

  search for 123 in file 'largefile':

    bingrep largefile 313233

  search for 'grep' in ascii and unicode representation:

    bingrep largefile 67726567 0067007200650067
