= NAME =

aho-corasick binary grep

= DESCRIPTION =

"acbgrep" is a grep for large binary files. It uses an aho-corasick implementation from the "fairly fast packet filter" project to search for multiple patterns at once.

Very large files, i.e. harddisk images are supported.

Binary data is passed to acbgrep via the command line as hexstrings:

  A => 40

For each hit the offset for the pattern position in the file is printed.

= USAGE = 

Example usage:

  search for 123 in file 'largefile':

    acbgrep largefile 313233

  search for 'grep' in ascii and unicode representation:

    acbgrep largefile 67726567 0067007200650067
